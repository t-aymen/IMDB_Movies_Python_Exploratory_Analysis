# IMDB Movies Exploratory Analysis Project
We take the role of a market analyst for a newly established film studio who wants to use data to shape their understanding of the filming industry and inform the productions of their new movies.

## Conext and Objective
The studio's current understanding of the market states that a movie's success is largely dependant on its budget, and would like to explore further factors that may contribute to this success such as genres, actors, etc.

## Data Source
The IMDB Movies dataset is an open data publicly available on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset/data'> Kaggle </a> and contains information such as movies' release date, country of origin, genres, crews, rating scores, budget and revenue figures.

<i><b>Disclaimer</b>: The IMDB Movies dataset contains a lot of inaccurate and/or erronous data that do not reflect the actual state of the filming industry. therefore, use <ins>only for educational purposes</ins> </i>.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains all the Python scripts pertaining to our exploratory analysis. You can find the final storyboard presentation available on <a href='https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aymen.touihri/viz/IMDBMoviesCaseStudy-Storyboard/Storyboard?publish=yes'> Tableau Public </a>.
